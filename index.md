## About Me

I am an AI researcher with a strong background in working with real-world data and developing
  models aimed at practical applications. I am eager to contribute my skills to a dynamic team dedicated
  to solving cutting-edge challenges.


## Work Experiences

- **Seoul National University Hospital (SNUH)**
  * Hosted by Prof. Chang Wook Jeong
  * Mar 2022 – Present, Seoul, Korea




## Research Interests
My research focuses on artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in multi-modal and AI agent. I’m driven to leverage AI’s capabilities to tackle complex problems. My work explores three key areas:

- **Multi-modality:** Large language and vision model (LLAVA), CLIP
- **Cost-effective Learning:** Self-superivsed learning, Domain adaptation
- **AI agent:** Agent with personal preferences

## News
- **[Dec. 2024]** We launch SUPER data dashboard.
- **[Nov. 2024]** Our paper about surgical-llava is accepted to NeurIPS AIM-FM 2024.
